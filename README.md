## NOTICE

### Integrated Graphics Device Properties Injection
The built-in monitor is actually HDMI-connected monitor.As for its IGFX Configuration,con1 with busid=0x2 is confirmed to work!While the other one in Odin Android Console may not work at the same time.(Glitches may be occurred!!!)
### Audio adjustment
Due to the defect of Odin Android Smart Screen,you CANNOT adjust the volume through macOS(No HDMI Audio Mixer code support) and Third-party software like Lunar or BetterDisplay(DDS not supported).The only way to adjust volume is its button on the bottom of the screen!
### USB Power issue
Due to weird reason,the USB which is integrated into the Odin device don't work properly sometimes.According to GK,this might be the Power Supply issue.As a result,the macOS will get stuck near boot.efi stage(with the line "LKC").
### Why should I install Hackintosh in MY SCHOOL?!?!
The answer is simple.To Zhuang Bi.
